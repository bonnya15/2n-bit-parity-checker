# 2n-bit-parity-checker
The parity function takes as input a vector of 2n bits and checks if the number of 0's (and 1's) in the input is even. It is more convenient to think of the input as a vector (x1, x2, …, x2n) where each xi ∈ {-1,+1}. The parity function then reports the product x1x2…x2n, which is +1 if the parity is even and -1 if it is odd.

We have trained a Deep Neural Network for this parity checker function and we have also implemented the function using manual neural network.
